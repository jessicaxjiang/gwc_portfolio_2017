	I am a rising junior at Julia R. Masterman Laboratory and Demonstration School. My family moved to the United States        in the mid 1990s from FuZhou, FuJian, China to New York then Philadelphia (where I was borned). I have always wanted        to work in the STEM field but I am not quite sure which at the moment. At my high school, I am the stage manager for        the annual musical (also, co-captain of stage crew). I am deeply involved with an international volunteer            		organization called Youth Volunteer Corps; Currently, I am on my local advisory board and just recently been                accepted into the International Youth Advisory Board (IYAB). Also, I am on my school's math team and badminton team. Occasionally, I edit videos for fun. <br> P.S I am NOT a morning person and WILL NOT be awake before noon unless I REALLY have to be for whatever reason. ^-^

        Scratch Side Scrolling Video Game <br> <br>
	 I worked with a partner to design a side scroller game on Scratch. We used the popular game "Flappy Bird" as a model to base off our game on. Our game was space themed and had a rocket ship navigating through various space objects that moved towards it. <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/168529495/">link to game</a>
